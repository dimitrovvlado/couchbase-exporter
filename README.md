# Couchbase exporter

A Prometheus Couchbase Exporter based on:
https://github.com/brunopsoares/prometheus_couchbase_exporter

The reason this repository exists is that [other containers](https://hub.docker.com/r/billmoritz/couchbase-exporter/) packaging the same application are based on [Alpine linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) only, which could be restrictive.
